            <p id ="aboutText">Accept the cookies is a cookie company based in Oshawa, ON, their main goal is to provide North America with cookies from around the world of only the highest quality. Accept the Cookies was founded in 2013 by a group of friends who when traveling Europe visited many bakeries. Despite most bakeries being rather the same they came across a small shop in Marseille, France run by a man named Pierre Durand. As per their routine, the group tried everything the shop had to offer, but one thing stood out to them, the cookies. They never had cookies of such variety or quality in North America. Amazed by what they had discovered they knew they had to bring these styles of cookies back to Canada for their friends and family. Upon returning home they quickly ran out of the cookies they so enjoyed, knowing that they could not get the same anywhere at home they began attempting to recreate the cookies. After feedback from many friends and family the group knew that they had to bring these cookies to Canada . After many attempts, they never were able to recreate the same cookies. After much frustration and attempts the group had almost given up the dream. This was until one final push of desperation brought the idea to their minds “The only way to recreate them is with the recipe, we must find its creator”. The group headed back to Marseille where they returned to find Pierre. The group then explained their idea for a business to Pierre. Initially, hesitant Pierre agreed on the condition that the cookies continue to be made using french ingredients. Pierre, Accepted the Cookies. After much work, the group began to build their company into what it is today.
